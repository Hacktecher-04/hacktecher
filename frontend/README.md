# Frontend Documentation

## Overview
This documentation details the frontend application's structure and functionality.

## Project Structure
- **vite.config.js**: Vite configuration for the React project.
- **src/main.jsx**: Entry point that renders the application.
- **src/App.jsx**: Contains the main App component.
- **src/routes/AppRoutes.jsx**: Defines routing using React Router.
- **src/screens/Home.jsx**: Home screen component with animations and API integration.
- **src/index.scss**: Global styles for the project.

## Key Features
- **React & Vite**: Fast development environment using Vite with React.
- **Routing**: Handled by React Router in `AppRoutes.jsx`.
- **Animations**: Utilizes GSAP for UI animations in components.
- **API Integration**: Communicates with back-end via Axios.

## Running the Application
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Additional Notes
- Styles are defined in SCSS and adjusted for responsiveness.
- Component state management is handled using React hooks.
